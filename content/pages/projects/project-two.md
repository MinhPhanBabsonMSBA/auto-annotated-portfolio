### Portfolio Simulation (Equal Weighted Method)

*   **Portfolio Performance:** Track the cumulative returns of a portfolio with equal-weighted assets.
*   **Correlation Heatmap:** Visualize the correlation between assets in the portfolio.
*   **Portfolio Metrics:** Calculate key metrics such as average annual return, Sharpe Ratio, Treynor Ratio, and Information Ratio.
*   **Comparison to S\&P 500:** Benchmark your portfolio's performance against the S\&P 500.
